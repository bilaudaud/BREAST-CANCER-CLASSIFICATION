# BREAST-CANCER-CLASSIFICATION
 - Predicting if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several observations/features
 - 30 features are used, examples:
          - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)  
          - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
          - perimeter        
          - area 
          - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
          - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)         
          - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)         
          - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)         
          - symmetry          
          - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)  
          - Datasets are linearly separable using all 30 input features 
          - Number of Instances: 569 
          - Class Distribution: 212 Malignant, 357 Benign
          - Target class:          - Malignant          - Benign
