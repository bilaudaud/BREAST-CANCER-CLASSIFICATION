# BREAST-CANCER-CLASSIFICATION
 - Predicting if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several observations/features  - 30 features are used, examples:         - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)         - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)         - perimeter         - area         - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)         - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)         - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)         - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)         - symmetry          - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)  - Datasets are linearly separable using all 30 input features - Number of Instances: 569 - Class Distribution: 212 Malignant, 357 Benign - Target class:          - Malignant          - Benign   https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)
